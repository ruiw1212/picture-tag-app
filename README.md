The positions of these boxes and their contents need to be manually created, and the software is responsible for recording them.

The software allows for manual adjustments of the box positions, altering the sizes of the boxes, or deleting the boxes and their contents, and it records the modified positions. It also enables manual editing of the text content within the boxes and records the updated content.
